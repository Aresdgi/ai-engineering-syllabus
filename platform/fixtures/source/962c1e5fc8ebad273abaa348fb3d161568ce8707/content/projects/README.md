# AI Engineering Projects

Repository of hands-on projects for the **AI Engineering** program at 4Geeks Academy. Each folder is a standalone project with its own README, evaluation criteria, and (when applicable) `learn.json` for the platform.

Projects follow a pedagogical order: from web fundamentals (HTML, CSS, SEO, accessibility) and Tailwind, through company milestones and collaboration, **OpenClaw agent setup and integrations**, then TypeScript and system design, React/Next.js and AI-assisted delivery, APIs, authentication, agents, performance, telemetry, data pipelines, background jobs, message queues, RAG knowledge bases, agentic RFP workflows, real-time systems, and a **final 5-minute project pitch**.

21. **[Company financial dashboard context project](./company-financial-dashboard-context-project)**  
    Module project: drive a coding agent to understand an unfamiliar full-stack repo (no prior stack knowledge required), verify claims against code, derive and test `.agents/rules` from repo evidence, and leave a `memory-bank` (product, stack, status) so the repo is agent-ready.

22. **[Company financial dashboard specs project](./company-financial-dashboard-specs-project)**  
    Continue on the inherited financial dashboard repo: drive a coding agent to explore `/docs`, draft TypeScript types, `components.md`, and a data-contract README for three PM features—verify every field against OpenAPI. No React implementation.

23. **[Company financial dashboard skills project](./company-financial-dashboard-skills-project)**  
    Continue on the inherited financial dashboard repo (after context project): drive a coding agent to apply `accessibility` and `vercel-react-best-practices`, discover one more skill via `npx skills find`, author an internal `.skills/` file (commits, deployment, testing/QA, or repo-specific), verify outcomes, and update the memory bank.

24. **[Milestone 4 — AI-driven Engineering](./ai-eng-milestone-ai-driven-engineering)**

28. **[AI basic Inventory Agent Loop](./ai-basic-inventory-agent-loop)**  
    Build a basic FastAPI inventory API plus a Python AI agent loop that uses API endpoints as tools, logs each interaction to CSV, and supports natural-language stock operations.

29. **[Supplier Directory — Lightweight Storage API](./ai-eng-supplier-directory)**  
    FastAPI + TinyDB + Pydantic supplier API: seeded data from `CONTEXT`, validation, CRUD, and filter endpoints (by country and category) with rate-change timestamps.

30. **[Securing the API: Authentication and Route Restriction in FastAPI](./ai-eng-user-authentication-api)**

36. **[EduTrack Data Audit](./edutrack-data-audit-sql)**  
    SQL audit on a single-table enrollments dataset: data-quality checks, aggregations, and written findings for an operations lead.

37. **[EduTrack Data Audit — Related Tables](./edutrack-data-audit-sql-related-tables)**  
    Multi-table SQL on a normalized EduTrack schema: JOINs, cross-table metrics, and answers that require relating students, courses, and enrollments.

38. **[Company Project Milestone: Backend — Inventory Management](./ai-eng-milestone-backend-development)**  
    `Milestone 5` (backend) — FastAPI + SQLModel inventory API on Supabase: dual-database setup, inbound/outbound orders, and business rules from `CONTEXT-company.md`.

39. **[Company Project Milestone: Backoffice — Inventory Management](./ai-eng-inventory-management-backoffice)**

44. **[Performance Optimisation: Caching](./ai-eng-performance-caching)**  
    Profile frontend and API hot paths, implement justified caching (TTL, `useMemo`, FastAPI cache), and document trade-offs in a technical report.

45. **[Designing your company's telemetry plan](./ai-eng-telemetry-plan)**  
    Design `telemetry-plan.md` and `event-schemas.json` from CONTEXT mandatory metrics plus a broad opportunity catalogue before any instrumentation code.

46. **[Company's Telemetry – Frontend capture](./ai-eng-telemetry-capture)**  
    Stub `POST /telemetry/events` + `TelemetryService` (queue, batch/debounce, `sendBeacon`, retry) instrumenting CONTEXT mandatory metrics and a technical baseline via single `track()`.

47. **[Company's Telemetry – Storage](./ai-eng-telemetry-storage)**  
    Replace stub with Supabase `telemetry_events`: per-event validation, bulk insert, `{ received, stored, rejected }`, frontend untouched.

48. **[Company's Telemetry – Technical Report](./ai-eng-telemetry-report)**  
    Pandas technical/operational pipeline plus `GET /telemetry/report` (≥3 metrics, 60s cache) — not a business dashboard.

49. **[Designing a Data Pipeline: From Raw Data to Reliable Insights](./designing-data-pipeline)**  
    Standalone ETL design exercise for Veridian Logistics: analyze nightly CSV exports with updates-as-inserts, document deduplication and idempotency, and produce `PIPELINE_DESIGN.md` — no orchestration code.

50. **[Milestone 6 — Company's Data Pipeline Design (1/3)](./ai-eng-milestone-data-pipeline-design)**  
    `Milestone 6` (design) — Document a production-ready telemetry pipeline in the company monorepo: current state, ETL flow diagram, idempotency, execution log, and Prefect mapping before writing code.

51. **[Milestone 6 — Implementing a Resilient Data Pipeline (2/3)](./ai-eng-milestone-data-pipeline-build)**  
    `Milestone 6` (build) — Implement Prefect extract-transform-load flows in the monorepo with retries, idempotent loads, script-based execution, and pipeline status/trigger API endpoints.

52. **[Milestone 6 — Company's Data Pipeline Enhancement: Subflows and Tests (3/3)](./ai-eng-milestone-data-pipeline-enhancement)**  
    `Milestone 6` (enhancement) — Refactor the pipeline into reusable subflows, add isolated unit tests for transformation tasks, and ensure script-based execution via `python data/pipelines/pipeline.py`.

53. **[Background Processes](./ai-eng-cronjobs)**  
    Nightly telemetry export cronjob in the company monorepo: independent CLI script, `job_runs` state machine, distributed lock, idempotent CSV export, pipeline subprocess trigger, and `TARGET_DATE` override for testing.

54. **[Branch Queue — Tagged Service Queue](./branch-queue)**  
    Terminal Python queue manager for a bank branch: one deque per service type, global ticket counter, CLI menu, and design notes on per-service queues vs a shared list — stdlib only.

55. **[Triage Queue — Priority Queue Manager](./triage-queue)**  
    Terminal Python priority queue for an emergency unit: triage levels 1–3 with FIFO within level, five core operations, CLI menu, and data-structure design notes — stdlib only.

56. **[Message Queues and Async Tasks](./ai-eng-message-queue)**  
    Decouple heavy API work with Redis and Celery in the company monorepo: `202` + `task_id`, `GET /tasks/{task_id}`, retries with backoff, Dead Letter Queue, separate worker process, and Flower monitoring.

57. **[Sentiment Analysis on Customer Reviews — WeLoveReviews](./existing-model-sentiment-analysis-reviews)**  
    Integrate `nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment` from Hugging Face to classify 500 service reviews, find false negatives from product-review domain mismatch, validate predictions manually, and deliver a client-ready report.

58. **[StreamLoop — Tuning the Churn Model](./streamloop-churn-model-tuning)**  
    Tune a churn classifier on StreamLoop's telecom-style dataset: sklearn Pipeline with internal preprocessing, default baseline, RandomizedSearchCV → GridSearchCV on train only, business-aligned scoring, `cv_results_` stability review, and `tuning_report.md`.

59. **[Milestone 7 — RAG & Knowledge Base](./ai-eng-milestone-rag-knowledge-base)**  
    `Milestone 7` — Modular RAG in the company monorepo: chunk and index CONTEXT documents in Qdrant (`setup`, `embed`), retrieve with similarity threshold, generate salesperson-voice answers (`query`), expose `POST /knowledge/query` via FastAPI, minimal query UI, and unit tests — no LangChain; never return raw vector hits.

60. **[Support Agent with LangGraph — Part 1: Migration and Agent Flow](./ai-eng-langgraph-agent-base)**  
    `Part 1 of 2` — Wrap Milestone 7 RAG in a compiled LangGraph with minimal state, single-responsibility nodes, conditional edges, checkpointing, queryable traces, evals in `tests/pipelines/`, and `POST /agent/query` — reuse `data/pipelines/` without duplication.

61. **[Support Agent with LangGraph — Part 2: Tools Outside the RAG](./ai-eng-langgraph-agent-tools)**  
    `Part 2 of 2` — Extend the Part 1 graph with typed external tools: incident ticket lookup against your real incident manager API (timeout + honest fallback), optional inventory lookup, automatic RAG vs tool routing, extended traces, and ≥2 new routing evals in `tests/pipelines/` — no simulated operational data.

62. **[MCP Server: Connecting Your Agent to the Company's Tools](./ai-eng-mcp-company-tools)**  
    Expose Incidents Manager and read-only inventory as an authenticated FastMCP server (API Key, least privilege, discovery schemas, invocation logs), validate with an MCP client, and migrate the LangGraph support agent to consume incidents through MCP instead of direct HTTP tools.

63. **[Milestone 8 — Agent Memory and Self-Improvement (Part 1 of 2)](./ai-eng-milestone-agentic-engineering)**  
    `Milestone 8` Part 1 — Extend the LangGraph company agent (RAG + MCP) with persistent memory: explicit read/write interface, structured `memory_proposal`, in-conversation propose → classified confirm → audit → consolidate — only CONTEXT-allowed facts, never silent auto-writes. Same agent identity as Part 2.

64. **[Milestone 8 — Securing Agents: Harness and Guardrails (Part 2 of 2)](./ai-eng-agent-harness)**  
    `Milestone 8` Part 2 — Lock down the **same** company agent after memory: CONTEXT-aligned secure system prompt, content/scope guardrails (personal-use block + casual redirect), anti-injection isolation for RAG/MCP text, output validation, guardrail observability, and **deterministic** harness tests — layered defenses, not a single filter or live-LLM-only gate.

65. **[Milestone — Agentic RFP Workflow: Intake & Routing (Part 1 of 3)](./ai-eng-milestone-agentic-workflows-orchestrate)**  
    `Milestone 9` Part 1 — Agentic RFP intake: triage router, RFP filter, orchestrator-worker decomposition into parallel workstreams, then synthesizer into the defined workstream structure from CONTEXT.

66. **[Milestone — Agentic RFP Workflow: Response Generation (Part 2 of 3)](./ai-eng-milestone-agentic-workflows-evaluate)**  
    `Milestone 9` Part 2 — Map workstreams to departments, generate and self-evaluate each section, and produce department assignment tickets — same ticket row as Part 1.

67. **[Milestone — Agentic RFP Workflow: Approval & Completion (Part 3 of 3)](./ai-eng-milestone-agentic-workflows-produce)**  
    `Milestone 9` Part 3 — Human-in-the-loop interrupt/resume per department, parallel branches under interrupt, CONTEXT conflict arbiter, automatic final-document synthesis, and E2E continuity from Parts 1–2.

68. **[Milestone — Real-Time Systems: Agent Observability (Part 1 of 2)](./ai-eng-milestone-real-time-agent-observability)**  
    `Milestone 10` Part 1 — Persist Agent / Flow / Task with trigger chains, SSE named events (`agent_step`, `agent_status_changed`), JWT-protected backoffice panel (live list/detail + paginated history) for the conversational agent and RFP pipeline — observe only; control is Part 2. CONTEXT: [`10-realtime/agent-observability`](../contexts/10-realtime/agent-observability).

69. **[Milestone — Real-Time Systems: Agent Control (Part 2 of 2)](./ai-eng-milestone-real-time-agent-control)**  
    `Milestone 10` Part 2 — Wire Part 1 available-actions into real `pause` / `resume` / `cancel` over WebSocket: reuse LangGraph checkpoints, pub/sub fan-out, JWT-derived `actor_id` audit, terminal cancel vs resumable pause — kill switch, not business approval. CONTEXT: [`10-realtime/agent-control`](../contexts/10-realtime/agent-control).

70. **[Capstone — Final Project Video: 5-Minute AI Pitch](./ai-eng-capstone-project)**  
    Capstone — Record a ~5-minute landscape pitch of the company AI system: hook, problem, live demo, engineering trade-offs, and a cut-ready 4Geeks Q&A. Deliver a Google Drive (or similar) folder with `FirstnameLastname-ProjectName.mp4`, a 1–2 sentence description, and the signed media release.

## For Devs course

Separate track under [`./4-devs`](./4-devs). Contexts live in [`../contexts/4-devs`](../contexts/4-devs).

- **[Operations Backoffice – Incident Manager](./4-devs/ai-eng-incident-manager-for-devs)**  
  Steward + feature: derive monorepo conventions into `.agents/rules` and a `memory-bank`, then ship a CONTEXT-driven incident manager with lifecycle and change traceability (`contexts/4-devs/incident-manager-for-devs`).

- **[Operations Backoffice – Inventory Manager](./4-devs/ai-eng-inventory-manager-for-devs)**  
  Spec Driven Development: EARS `spec` / `plan` / `tasks`, inventory where stock is derived from movements, tests mapped to criteria, mid-stream requirement change via spec-first (`contexts/4-devs/inventory-manager-for-devs`).

## Other projects

Not part of the syllabus sequence. Kept here for reference or optional use.

- **[Platform – Roles and Permissions](./ai-eng-roles-permissions)**  
  Independent role and department axes on the company platform: centralized 403 enforcement, department-scoped data, and an Admin-only roles/departments view.

- **[Platform – Federated Authentication](./ai-eng-federated-authentication)**  
  Link Google / Microsoft / LinkedIn from an existing profile only: federated login never creates accounts; OAuth `state` + `redirect_uri`; audit rejected attempts.

- **[Platform – Audit Log](./ai-eng-audit-log)**  
  Append-only auditable event trail with tamper evidence, process-vs-human attribution, and role/department-scoped querying.

- **[Platform – Asynchronous Processing](./ai-eng-async-processing)**  
  Move one external-provider operation off the request cycle: worker queue, exponential backoff, DLQ, idempotency keys, and queryable task status.

- **[Platform – Security Hardening](./ai-eng-security-hardening)**  
  Guided OWASP audit on your monorepo app: ≥3 real findings with before/after proof, rate limits on sensitive endpoints, and secrets rotation documentation.

- **[Real-Time Systems (Part 1 of 2): SSE Notifications](./ai-eng-real-time-notification)**  
  Post-graduation extra — Push RFP ticket notifications to the company dashboard over SSE: named event + CONTEXT payload, keep-alive, `fetch` + `ReadableStream`, progressive backoff reconnect without duplicates — communication layer only (no model/agent). Not the same as in-syllabus agent observability (`ai-eng-milestone-real-time-agent-observability`).

- **[Real-Time Systems (Part 2 of 2): WebSocket Chat Streaming](./ai-eng-real-time-communication)**  
  Post-graduation extra — Bidirectional WebSocket for the existing support agent: token streaming, mid-response interrupt + checkpointing, pub/sub per session, live typing UI, backoff reconnect — reuse Part 1 event naming; do not rewrite agent logic. Not the same as in-syllabus agent control (`ai-eng-milestone-real-time-agent-control`).
